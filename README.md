# agentloop

A small, generic **agent loop** that drives CLI coding agents (`claude`, `codex`)
to solve problems — and to argue with each other until they converge.

The engine knows nothing about any specific task. Every turn it asks a **policy**
who speaks next and what they see, runs that agent as a subprocess, records the
result in a shared transcript, and checks the **stop conditions**. Reviewing a PR
with two models is just one configuration of those parts.

```
Orchestrator ── select speaker → compose prompt → agent.send → record → check stop
   ├── Agent            the unit that takes a turn
   │     └── CliAgent   subprocess + session resume + JSON parsing
   │           ├── ClaudeAgent   claude -p --output-format json
   │           └── CodexAgent    codex exec --json
   ├── Policy           who speaks + what they see   ← the generic knob
   │     ├── RoundRobinPolicy
   │     └── DebatePolicy        A reviews → B critiques → A revises …
   └── StopCondition    MaxRounds · Consensus("AGREED") · BudgetUSD
```

## Setup

```bash
uv sync
```

Requires the `claude` and `codex` CLIs installed and logged in.

## Use it

```bash
# Two agents debate an open problem until they agree (or hit the round cap):
uv run agentloop debate "Design a token-bucket rate limiter for our API"

# Two agents review the current branch's diff and reconcile findings:
uv run agentloop review --base main --head HEAD --budget 1.50

# Same review, as a library script you can edit:
uv run python examples/pr_review.py --base main --head HEAD
```

## As a library

```python
from agentloop import ClaudeAgent, CodexAgent, DebatePolicy, Consensus, Orchestrator

loop = Orchestrator(
    agents=[ClaudeAgent("claude"), CodexAgent("codex", sandbox="read-only")],
    policy=DebatePolicy("Find the bug in foo.py and agree on a fix."),
    stop=[Consensus("AGREED")],
    max_rounds=6,
    on_message=lambda m: print(f"{m.author}: {m.content}"),
)
result = loop.run()
print(result.stopped_by, result.transcript.total_cost_usd)
```

## Extending it

- **New agent** (Gemini, Aider, a local model): subclass `CliAgent`, implement
  `_build_command` and `_parse`. Session resume and timeouts come for free.
- **New interaction pattern**: subclass `Policy`. `select` picks the speaker;
  `compose` decides what context that speaker receives. This is where
  brainstorming vs. debate vs. judge-and-revise lives.
- **New stop rule**: any `(Context) -> bool` callable — e.g. "stop when a
  verdict line matches a regex" or "stop after N findings".

## Develop

```bash
uv run pytest          # loop logic is tested offline with a fake agent
uv run ruff check .    # lint + import sorting
uv run ruff format .   # format
uv run ty check        # type check
```
